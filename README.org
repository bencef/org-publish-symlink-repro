* Managed to separate a good and a bad situation

** File structure

The publishable project lives in [[file:long/path/to/something/index.org]]

There's a symlink called [[file:shortcut]] which links to [[file:long/path/to]]

** Good scenario

1. Open the project as [[file:long/path/to/something/index.org]].
2. Evaluate the code block.
3. Publish the project with =C-c C-e P x TAB RET=
4. Notice that =theindex.inc= is populated.


** Bad scenario

1. Open the project as [[file:shortcut/something/index.org]].
2. Evaluate the code block.
3. Publish the project with =C-c C-e P x TAB RET=
4. Notice that =theindex.inc= is *not* populated.

** Caveat

Make sure emacs doesn't resolve the symlink beforehand.
You can check by validating the path in the code block result.
